CASCADE - Cascade in SQL is used to delete or update an entry from both the child and the parent table simultaneously.
The keyword CASCADE is used as conjunction while writing the query of ON DELETE or ON UPDATE. When a cascade keyword 
is added while writing a query for a parent table, then both the parent and child table get changed accordingly.
